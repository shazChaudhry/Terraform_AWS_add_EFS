# Inspiration

Inspiration for this repo was a YouTube tutorial from [KnowledgeIndia](https://www.youtube.com/knowledgeIndia) where it was shown how to create and mount an EFS resource to a couple of linux machines.

## Scope

I wanted to take a step further and automate the instructions. This includes:

- Using modules from Terraform registry
- Using cloud init config as user-data
- Encripting data at rest

The idea is that infrastructure should be setup without human intervention

## Terraform commands

This is how infrastrucutre is setup with Terraform:

- See instruction on how to generate a new [SSH key](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent) and adding it to the ssh-agent
- `export TF_VAR_public_key=$(ssh-keygen -y -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa)` _(This will be required unless public_key in variables.tf is already set. This public ssh key will be placed on the launched EC2 instances. And a user called "admin" will be able to log in without a password)_
- `terraform init`
- `terraform apply -auto-approve`

The commands above will cuase the following to happen in your AWS account:

1. Create a VPC with four subnets; 2x private and 2x public
1. Pass a cloud config template to EC2 instances during launch time. This template contains scripts to mount EFS
1. Create security groups needed for SSH and EFS ports
1. Create EFS resources that will be added to EC2 instances
1. Launch two EC2 instances in private subnets
1. Launch one EC2 instance in public subnet. This EC2 instance will act as a jump box to private EC2 instances

```

```

## Test

1. Once Terraform has finised execution successfully, please wait for about 5mins for all reasources to be created and be in ready state
1. SSH to each private EC2 instance in turn
    - `ssh admin@[PUBLIC_INSTANCE_IP]`
    - `ssh admin@[FIRST_PRIVATE_INSTANCE_IP]`
1. Check "/efs" folder is created and then plase some content in that folder.
1. SSH to the second box and check for the content created above. It should be the same
    - `ssh admin@[SECOND_PRIVATE_INSTANCE_IP]`
1. once all done, exit from your EC2 instances and then you may delete the infrastructure
    - ``terraform destroy -auto-approve``
